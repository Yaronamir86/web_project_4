# Project 4-9: Around The U.S.

### Overview




a Responsive web application for sharing images in a social way which is actually a project that build in a long process and it's a part of my main study in PRACTICUM Yandex .. i went through a lot of things to reach this spot, starting from building this page using FIGMA with simple HTML5 and CSS3 in a flat BEM structure, with full responsive and adaptivity using grid layouts and flexbox, and then i added the  different popups, for editing and adding all kinds of data in the page using JAVA SCRIPT, the next step of the project was behind the scenes, we learned how to improve our code and write it in different files, and how to connect them using "import" and "export", we also learned how to write private and independent functions along public functions, using classes, instances, and handlers.
 the next steps in the process were very intresting, the first one is the connection of the page to a Webpack and babel transpailer using Node Package Manager, and the second one is the API, which takes this whole parts in this project to a one magnificent little social network.
